## Core Idea
### Problem Definition
ADAS features such as ACC, AEB, and LK are becoming increasingly important for vehicle safety. However, their performance can vary depending on road surface condition such as wet, icy, snowy, or dry roads. We wanted to enhance ADAS safety and reliability by incorporating real-time road condition awareness into the system.

### Rough Solution Idea
Our approach is to develop a **Road Condition Recognition Layer** that estimates road surface condition and classifies road surface types using multi-sensor data (e.g. camera, radar, vehicle dynamics).

These layers are then integrated with ADAS features to refine thier behavior:
- **ACC(Adaptive Cruise Control)** : ACC automatically maintains a set speed chosen by the driver, while also adjusting the vehicle's speed to keep a safe distance from the car ahead. Changes mode(Cruise, Follow, AEB) depending on the distance between the obstacles ahead and TTC(Time to Collision).
- **RCR(Road Condition Recognition)** : RCR detects the road surface condition using camera, IMU, odometer and applies additional distance, TTC on the ACC depending on the weather conditions.
- **LK(Lane Keeping)** : LK prevents the vehicle from unintentionally departing its current lane by providing gentle steering corrections.

By integrating road condition recognition with ADAS, our system aims to achieve safer and more adaptive driving across diverse conditions.

## Project Workflow
### Development process
- Design project architecture.
- Based on project architecture, each team member will be responsible for developing specific modules.
- Communication between modules will be aligned and refined through continuous integration.
- Appropriate Eclipse tools will be applied in each part of the project to support data communication and orchestration.
- CARLA simulator will be used regularly to validate the system, identify errors, and improve reliability through iterative testing and debugging.
- Project progress and decisions will be continuously documented in the shared workspace, allowing all team members to access and collaborate effectively.
- Decisions will be made collaboratively through open discussions, ensuring the project moves in the right direction during the hackathon.
